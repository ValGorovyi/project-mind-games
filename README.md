Answers to questions should be without extra characters (dots at the end, extra spaces, etc), in lowercase.
You can use '+' and '-' instead of 'yes' and 'no'. 

The calculator rounds to one digit after the dot, for example 4.7. Use the character '*.*'

The game goes until the first wrong answer or three correct ones.
